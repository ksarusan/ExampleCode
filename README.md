# ExampleCode
This project is an example for implementing the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm.\ The training data is used to obtain the priors and the likelihoods for each feature, assuming independence of the features.\
The test data is not used here, but this code can be extended to classify the test points as well as to obtain a metric for the classification error for example. 

To run the code, install the needed packages (e.g. pandas) and run "nbayes_summarize_data.py --traindir nbayes_data/train --outdir output".
